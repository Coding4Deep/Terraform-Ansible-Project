# Springboot Fullstack Infrastructure Automation with Terraform + Ansible

---

##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates **fully automated infrastructure provisioning and configuration** for a full-stack Spring Boot web application using:

* **Terraform**: to provision AWS infrastructure (VPC, Subnets, EC2 instances, Security Groups, SSH Key, etc.)
* **Ansible**: to install and configure required software on provisioned instances (Tomcat, Memcached, RabbitMQ, MongoDB)
* **AWS EC2 Dynamic Inventory Plugin**: to avoid hardcoding any IP addresses; Ansible automatically discovers instances using AWS Tags.

With this project, anyone can provision infrastructure and configure services in a fully automated, repeatable, idempotent way.

## 🎯 End-to-End Usage Guide

### Step 1: Clone the Project Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### Step 2: Generate SSH Key Pair (once)

You need a public-private key pair to SSH into your instances.

```bash
cd terraform/
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f project-key
```

This will create:

* `project-key` (private key)
* `project-key.pub` (public key)

Terraform will automatically upload this public key to AWS.

### Step 3: Update Terraform Configuration

* Update `provider.tf` with your AWS region.
* Replace `ami-xxxxxxxx` with valid Ubuntu AMI ID from your region.

You can find Ubuntu AMI IDs here:

* [Ubuntu AMIs](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/)

### Step 4: Apply Terraform to Create Infrastructure

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

✅ Terraform will create the entire AWS infrastructure.
✅ After provisioning is done, Terraform automatically triggers Ansible via `null_resource` to configure all servers.

> **Note:** You may be prompted for approval during `terraform apply`.

### Step 5: Ansible Dynamic Inventory Setup

Ensure you have valid AWS credentials locally (`~/.aws/credentials`).

The file `ansible/inventory/aws_ec2.yaml` uses AWS EC2 dynamic inventory plugin to auto-discover EC2 instances using tags.

You can test Ansible inventory:

```bash
cd ../ansible/
ansible-inventory --graph
```

You should see:

```
@all:
  |--@aws_ec2:
    |--@role_tomcat:
    |  |--springboot-public
    |--@role_memcached:
    |  |--springboot-memcached
    |--@role_rabbitmq:
    |  |--springboot-rabbitmq
    |--@role_mongo:
    |  |--springboot-mongo
```

No IP addresses needed. Fully dynamic!

### Step 6: Run Ansible Playbooks Manually (optional)

If you want to re-run Ansible manually anytime:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/site.yml
```

This will execute all roles (tomcat, memcached, rabbitmq, mongo).

## 📊 What Happens During Provisioning?

| Component          | Action                                                           |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Terraform          | Provisions VPC, Subnets, EC2 Instances, Security Groups, SSH Key |
| Ansible            | Dynamically discovers EC2 instances via AWS tags                 |
| Tomcat Playbook    | Installs Java, Downloads and Configures Apache Tomcat            |
| Memcached Playbook | Installs and Starts Memcached Service                            |
| RabbitMQ Playbook  | Installs and Starts RabbitMQ Server                              |
| MongoDB Playbook   | Adds official MongoDB repo, Installs MongoDB, Starts MongoDB     |

## 🚨 Cleaning Up Resources

After you're done, it's important to destroy the infrastructure to avoid AWS charges:

```bash
cd terraform/
terraform destroy
```

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Optional Improvements)

* Add NAT Gateway for better private subnet access
* Use Bastion Host for secure SSH into private instances
* Fully private subnets with no public IPs
* Jenkins CI/CD integration for full automation pipeline
* Monitoring with CloudWatch
* HTTPS with ACM and Load Balancer
